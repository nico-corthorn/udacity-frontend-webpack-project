				<p><span class="city">San Francisco</span>—A local hero came out of the crowd today at the Humane Animal Shelter Society of San Francisco, California, where local resident Sam Drake adopted 30 cats of various breeds and ages during a charity event.</p>
				<p>Adopting the cats was absolutely free, but taking care of the cats will be a major endeavour. A local bystander claims that Drake could not decide on which cat to take home, and eventually decided to just take them all. When asked what Drake planned to do with the feline friends, Sam replied "they are going to help me with my rat problem!"</p>
				<q>they [the cats] are going to help me with my rat problem!</q>
				<p>Sam, who admits to spending most of the day on Facebook, added "I am so happy to have all of these new friends. I've already got all of their names picked out."</p>

				<p><span class="city">Pebble Beach</span>—Charlie Cutter shock and awed crowds at Pebble Beach, California Golf Course by posting a course record setting 59 to beat the number 1 Tiger Woods, number 2 Phil Michelson, and number 3 Steve Stricker, along with Sergio Garcia, Padraig Harrington, and Camilo Villegas. Many other professional golfers also attended the game.</p>
				<p>Charlie Cutter chipped in for an eagle to start off the day at two under. Then he delivered back to back birdies on holes two, three, and four. He continued to play well for the rest of the day, to post a course record breaking 59. This all happened on a Monday morning non-media notified event with only a select few of the world's best golfers on the field. Charlie Cutter was unavailable for interviews, but all we can say is that Charlie Cutter is soon to be a name to look out for in the world of golf to come.</p>
