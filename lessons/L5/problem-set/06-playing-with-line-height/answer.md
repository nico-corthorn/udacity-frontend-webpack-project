Awesome job! You could have completed the tests a couple of different ways, so I've listed a few different answers below.

```css
.one {
  line-height: 22px;
  /* line-height: 1;     <- another way of writing it */
  /* line-height: 100%;  <- another way of writing it */
}

.two {
  line-height: 2;
  /* line-height: 44px;  <- another way of writing it */
  /* line-height: 200%;  <- another way of writing it */
}

.three {
  line-height: 300%;
  /* line-height: 66px;  <- another way of writing it */
  /* line-height: 3;     <- another way of writing it */
}
```

### Cool CSS Effects

...and what about those effects! Pretty cool, right?

Well if you didn't know already, CSS is pretty awesome! Those effects were actually created using `line-height` and a combination of `background-image` , `text-fill-color` , and `background-clip` .
