Mmmm, tasty! A nice bowl of soup.

_Wow, this problem set has a lot of food references. Maybe I should have eaten something before putting these exercises together..._

While alphabet soup is great, div soup is not so great. Div soup occurs when the majority of a webpage is built with `<div>`s. Technically, there is nothing wrong with this, but cognitively this is a problem. Your HTML should be descriptive and communicate what is happening on the page.

_I wonder what this HTML does?_

For this quiz, I want you to clean up some div soup. I've created a fictitious [landing page](http://udacity.github.io/fend/lessons/L5/problem-set/09-div-soup-clean-up/index.html) and it will be your job to replace `<div>`s with more meaningful markup. Download the .zip file containing the site's HTML and CSS from the resources section or directly from [this link](http://udacity.github.io/fend/lessons/L5/problem-set/09-div-soup-clean-up/div-soup-clean-up.zip) and modify the HTML to use semantic elements. Use [MDN's element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) if you need help.
