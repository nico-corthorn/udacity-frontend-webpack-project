Here's each answer one-by-one:

### Pythagorean Theorem

In order to fix the formula for the Pythagorean Theorem, you needed to add the following line of CSS to superscript the exponents.

```css
.exponent {
  vertical-align: super;
}
```

This fixes the equation to read `aÂ² + bÂ² = cÂ²`. Next time you need to calculate the side of a right triangle, you'll be ready!

### Chemical Equation for Ammonia

Ammonia is a chemical compound that is commonly used in household cleaners, and for this problem you needed to balance its chemical equation... well sort of, but not in the traditional sense.

Anyway, to fix this equation required adding this CSS to the class `.subscript` .

```css
.subscript {
  vertical-align: sub;
}
```

### Company Profile

Hey, who's that? That's just me playing slow-pitch softball ðŸ˜Ž !

To pass this test, you needed to find the `<div>` with the `.profile-details` class and add `vertical-align: top` . But aren't `<div>`s block elements? Yes, but this `<div>` was displayed as `inline-block` which allowed it to be vertically aligned next to the image.

### Pangram with Images

If you're wondering what a **pangram** is, it's a sentence or verse that contains all the letters of the alphabet. A common pangram example is _"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"_.

To fix this example required adding `vertical-align: middle` to both the fox and dog images. This might have seemed confusing at first, but really you're adjusting where the image is aligned relative to the text.
