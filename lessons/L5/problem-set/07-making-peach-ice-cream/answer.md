I'm getting hungry!

Anyway, your answer should have looked like this...

If you look at the final result, you can tell that with just a few small tweaks to the CSS, the recipe has started to take shape.

By adjusting the page to use `box-sizing: border-box` , the recipe summary and image both align at the top of the page. However, it's not just `border-box` alone that is helping us achieve this affect, in fact, both the recipe summary and image have a `width` of 50% and use a property called `float` in order to line up side-by-side like seen in solution. In the next lesson, we'll cover `float` and other positioning properties that will allow you to take full control of the layouts on your webpages.

Also, the adjustment to the recipe container's `width`, combined with `margin: 0 auto` , centered the entire recipe in the middle of the "page".

```css
.recipe {
  /* ... */
  width: 800px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

The next three adjustments focused on small aesthetic changes by adding spacing above and below the section titles, as well as using `<em>` to create an _emphasis_ on the recipe's author (Hey, that's me ðŸ˜Ž !). Pay attention to the changes for `padding` and `margin` on the section titles; specifically the `padding`. It was used to add space between the _content_ (the actual title itself) and the `border` that was being drawn underneath it.

_The padding is added below the content, but between the border._

Finally, the last adjustment was made to the recipe notes. By changing these to `display: inline` , the `width` of the notes were constrained to the content. Therefore, the notes lined up next to each other, rather than one on top of the other.

_Can you guess what each icon represents in the recipe notes?_
