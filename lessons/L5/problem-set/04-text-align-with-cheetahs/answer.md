Great job! I've added pictures of each completed `<div>` below.

### Wrapping Text Around Images with Floats

If you worked the tests in order, then you should have seen something like this after completing the fifth test:

![fifth div before float](http://udacity.github.io/fend/lessons/L5/problem-set/04-text-align-with-cheetahs/text-align-6.png)

It wasn't until after you added `float: right` to the image that you saw the text suddenly floated alongside it. Floats work great for wrapping text around images, but they can also be used to create entire web layouts! In the next lesson, you'll work more closely with floats as we discuss how to position elements. For now, click "Next" to start the next quiz.
