# Extending your Code Editor

By default, Sublime and Atom come with great features like keyboard shortcuts and multi-line editing, but what makes these tools even more powerful is their ability to be extended with packages and themes.

## Packages

Packages are used to extend the functionality of your text editor. Are you tired of typing out every element in HTML? There’s a package that can help with that. Wish your text editor could tell you if you forgot a semicolon at the end of a line? There’s a package for that too!

## Themes

You’ve probably noticed this by now, but when using Sublime or Atom, specific pieces of your code are colored and styled differently. This is called syntax highlighting, and it is a common feature used by text editors. Syntax highlighting makes code more readable and it can actually help when debugging.

Themes are a way for you to customize how the syntax highlighting works in your text editor. There are literally thousands of themes out there for you to pick from or you can create your own.
