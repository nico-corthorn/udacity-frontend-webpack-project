# Recommended Themes

Want your syntax highlighting to stand out? Below we’ve selected some of our favorite themes that we use here at Udacity. No theme is right or wrong, it’s really up to personal preference.

## Monokai

Based on the original TextMate theme designed by [Wimer Hazenberg](https://twitter.com/monokai), Monokai has become widely popular over the years. Monokai is the default color scheme used by Sublime; however, it is widely available on most text editors and IDEs.

## Solarized

Solarized is a sixteen color palette (eight monotones, eight accent colors) designed by [Ethan Schoonover](https://twitter.com/ethanschoonover) for use with terminal and GUI applications. The color scheme uses both precise lightness relationships and a refined set of hues based on fixed color wheel relationships.
