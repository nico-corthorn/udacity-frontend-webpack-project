# Recommended Packages

Sublime and Atom have thousands of packages available to install, but figuring out which ones to use can be a task in itself. So, below we’ve recommended some packages that you will definitely want to install (these packages are available in both Sublime and Atom). **After you install a package, make sure to restart your text editor in order for the changes to take effect.**

## Emmet

Emmet is a plugin for text editors that enables web developers to write HTML and CSS code faster. It does this by expanding simple CSS-like abbreviations into complex HTML and CSS code snippets.

## Color Highlighter

Color Highlighter is a plugin for Sublime, which unobtrusively previews color values in your code. Also, Color Highlighter comes with a built-in color picker and color format converter (hex, rgb, etc.) to make changing colors a breeze.

## Pigments

Pigments is a plugin for Atom that displays color in code. Similar to Color Highlighter for Sublime, Pigments unobtrusively previews color values in your code. Also, Pigments will scan source files in your project directories looking for colors and will build a palette with all of them. That’s pretty sweet!
