### How to Complete the Quiz

1. Download the files `start.html` and `finish.html` from the resources section or the .zip file from [here](http://udacity.github.io/fend/lessons/L4/concepts/04-keyboard-shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts.zip).
2. Open `start.html` and `finish.html` and place them side-by-side.

 * If you have two monitors, you can do this split-screen.
 * If you're using Sublime set your layout to two columns by navigating to `View â†’ Layout â†’ Columns: 2`.
 * If you're using Atom, add another pane by navigating to `View â†’ Panes â†’ Split Left` or `View â†’ Panes â†’ Split Right`.
 * If your screen is not big enough, print out `finish.html` and open `start.html` in your text editor.

3. Using only your keyboard, but **no keyboard shortcuts**, edit `start.html` to match `finish.html` exactly. Make sure to time yourself to see how long it takes. When you're finished, record your time **in seconds.**
4. Repeat Step 3, but this time **use keyboard shortcuts**. Again, make sure to time yourself and record your time **in seconds** once you're done.
5. On the next slide, enter your best times with and without keyboard shortcuts.

Remember, **only use your keyboard!** Donâ€™t just copy and paste the code from the second file, thatâ€™d be cheating. Feel free to complete the challenge as many as times as you'd like to improve your time. When you're ready to get started, click "Skip to Quiz". ðŸ‘Ÿ  Have fun!
